Advanced SQL to analyze YOY and MOM company growth 

As an analyst, you are likely to receive a number of one-off requests to provide answers to a variety of business questions. These requests can be time-sensitive and demand that you turn around a summary of your findings quickly. You will also have to juggle a number of these requests at the same time. This means that the deliverable for these types of ad hoc requests will usually be a short and concise summary of your findings. These short reports can include recommendations or insights if requested, but in other cases, they will only require hard numbers or other factual findings. 

This style of analysis allows you to extract insights from smaller sections of data as needed to answer more defined and focused business questions. It allows you to formulate specific insights for your organization when they are needed, as opposed to a more formal report such as a presentation or quarterly newsletter" 

Here I show you how to respond to multiple ad hoc requests from varying teams or persons in your organization. You may have to write a series of queries to answer questions and summarize your findings

The goal of this repository is to help you get comfortable breaking down and responding to an ad hoc request. You may need to be given guiding questions and instructions to assist you in thinking through the asks and to help guide the queries you are writing.
